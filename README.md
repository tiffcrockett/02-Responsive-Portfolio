For this assignment, I used Bootstrap to design a responsive webpage.  The project contains a navbar, responsive layout and responsive images. I also included animation on a few images.  My semantic HTML lays out the project logically, using Bootstrap's grid system of containers, rows and columns. 

Specifically, this project is my first online portfolio of completed web applications. 

I included an image of myself in the header.  In the About Me section, I explain a bit about myself and also showcases a logo that I designed in preparation of possible freelance work in the future. The navbar links to the actual portfolio of the three projects I have completed thus far.  There are screenshots of each project as well as a link to them. The contact section is totally self explanatory.  It consists only of a form for visitors to submit questions or commments about my work. Because I used Bootstrap, the site is mobile-first so, shrink down your page and check it out!

The entire site is fully functional. I could see future modifications including having better graphics and color scheme, and obviously an expanded portfolio section as I complete more projects. 

Note:  I am currently a student (11/2020) and this is a class assignment.  The contact form does not forward.  However, the social media and email links in the footer do work. Feel free to reach out.
