For this assignment, I used Bootstrap to design a responsive webpage.  The project contains a navbar, responsive layout and responsive images. I also included animation on a few images.  My semantic HTML lays out the project logically, using Bootstrap's grid system of containers, rows and columns. 

This project is my first online portfolio of completed web applications. 

There is an image of myself in the header.  The About Me section states a bit about me and showcases a logo that I designed in preparation for possible freelance work in the future. The project page contains a brief description and screenshot of each of my projects as well as a link to the repository. The contact section is self explanatory.  It consists only of a form for visitors to submit questions or commments about my work. Because I used Bootstrap, the site is mobile-first so size down your page and check it out!

I could see future modifications including having better graphics and color scheme, and obviously an expanded portfolio as I complete more projects. 

Note:  I am currently a student and this is a class assignment.  The contact form does not forward, however, the social media and email icons in the foote are linked. Feel free to reach out.
